# Digital Portfolio: LAN Security Investigation

---

## Introduction

**Questions:**
1. Which device inside a LAN would be the easiest to compromise, and why?  
2. Does proximity equal safety?  
3. How much can a device ‘see’ inside a LAN?

**Response:**  
*(Write your paragraph here.)*

## LAN Threat Scenario Rotation

| Scenario Letter | Symptoms |  Hypothesis |  Justification  |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| A | Default gateway does not match router| there is an issue with the DHCP server| |
| B | Switch CPU spikes and thousands of MACs appear on one port| | |
| C | Receives network settings from an unknown DHCP source | | |
| D | New device appears inside the broadcast domain and communicates broadly| | |
| E | | | |

**Reflection (5–7 sentences):**  
*(Discuss confidence, difficulty, group discussion insights, and patterns noticed.)*

## Task A — LAN Observation

**Screenshot:**  
*(Insert screenshot here.)*

**Reflection (2–3 sentences):**  
How could an attacker misuse this information?  
*(Explain using your VM outputs.)*

---

## Task B — Evidence-to-Threat Analysis

| Evidence from Your VM | Possible Threat Enabled | Why? (Explanation) |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## Task C — Threat Mini-Simulation

**Chosen Threat:** *(e.g., ARP Spoofing)*

**1. Attacker Requirements:**  
*(What the attacker needs to know first.)*

**2. Target Devices:**  
*(Which devices would be targeted.)*

**3. Victim Impact:**  
*(What changes or errors would the victim notice.)*

**4. VM Impersonation Choice:**  
*(Which VM the attacker would impersonate and why.)*

**Summary (3–4 sentences):**  
*(Explain how the threat exploits normal LAN behavior.)*

## Final Wrap-Up

### Part 1 — Screenshots from Both VMs

**VM #1 (Ubuntu Desktop):**  
*(Insert screenshot)*  
**Explanation:** Why would this information be valuable to an attacker?  

**VM #2 (Linux Server):**  
*(Insert screenshot)*  
**Explanation:** Why would this information be valuable to an attacker?
